# Metadata / Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the Raycast Store submission.

## Required Screenshot Size

**CRITICAL**: All screenshots must be exactly **2000 x 1250 pixels**.

You need 3-8 PNG screenshots showing your extension in action.

## How to Resize Your Screenshots

Your current screenshots are 1558 x 452 pixels and need to be resized to 2000 x 1250.

**Option 1: Using macOS sips (fastest)**
```bash
cd metadata
sips -z 1250 2000 withings-sync-1.png
sips -z 1250 2000 withings-sync-2.png
sips -z 1250 2000 withings-sync-3.png
```

**Option 2: Using macOS Preview**
1. Open each screenshot in Preview
2. Tools → Adjust Size
3. Set width to 2000 pixels, height to 1250 pixels
4. Uncheck "Scale proportionally" if needed
5. Save

**Option 3: Retake screenshots**
Take new screenshots that are 2000 x 1250 pixels from the start.

1. Main command view with extension features
